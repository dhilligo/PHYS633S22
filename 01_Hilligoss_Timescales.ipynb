This is amazing considering the sheer size of a star. Obviously, this does not occur in nature as there is a pressure force counteracting the inward pull of gravity, but this still provides valueable insight into micro-processes that are occuring within the Sun. The hydrodynamic timescale is important compared to the nuclear timescale because it shows that without some strong process to keep the star stable, it would collapse in upon itself in a very short period of time. This hydrodynamic timescale is there to maintain the stability between pressure and gravity. This makes calculating solar structure models easier because we can rule out  hydrodynamic processes as the main process that powers the Sun since its timescale is much smaller than observations suggest."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"RmWYBhui8Czp"},"source":["## **5.
